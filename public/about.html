<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a seasoned software engineer with a diverse skill set and a deep passion for coding and problem-solving.
   My journey in the world of software development has been both challenging and rewarding. I am proficient in Java and C++,
  two languages I consider my strong suits. These languages have been the foundation of many successful projects I've been a part of.</p>

<p>My expertise also extends to modern web development. I am well-versed in Spring Boot and Hibernate,
   enabling me to create efficient and powerful back-end systems. Additionally, I have a knack for crafting engaging
    and user-friendly front-end interfaces, thanks to my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>When it comes to data management, SQL is my ally. I can design, query, and maintain databases, ensuring that the data
   underpinning applications remains secure and accessible.
   I've ventured into the world of cloud computing and infrastructure management through AWS, giving me the ability to
   deploy applications, configure scalable environments, and harness the power of various AWS services.</p>
